    <h2>ID uniquely identifies any tag which could be helpful in targetting</h2>
    <div id="first">This has some ID</div>   <!--ID is basically a attribute for any tag-->
    <div id="second">This has some other Id</div>   <!--No two elements can have same Id or rather we should avoid it even if html lets you give same id because then there will be no point-->

    <h2>Class</h2>
    <span id="third" class="red">This has red class</span>
    <span id="third" class="red">This also has red class</span>
    <!--We can give(or group ) many tags under same class-->

    <span id="fourth" class="red blue">This has two classes</span>        <!--We can assign multiple classes two a tag-->

    <!--The concept of Id and Classes will be very helpful when doing styling because sometimes we need to style single element and multiple elements with same styling-->
